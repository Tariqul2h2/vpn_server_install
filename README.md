```

You may need to adjust other settings based on your specific requirements.

cd /etc/ocserv/cert
sudo certtool --generate-privkey --outfile server-key.pem
sudo certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey server-key.pem --outfile server-cert.pem
```
Follow the prompts to provide the necessary information for the certificate.

## Enable IP Forwarding:
Edit the sysctl.conf file:

## Configure Firewall (if applicable):
If you are using a firewall, make sure to allow traffic on the specified TCP/UDP port (default is 443).

## Connect to the VPN:
You can use the OpenConnect client to connect to your server. Install it on your client machine and use the following command:

```
sudo openconnect -b your_server_ip_or_domain
```
Replace your_server_ip_or_domain with the actual IP address or domain of your server.
